        <h1>Considerations for Choosing your Car</h1>
        <img src="image/about man.jpg" class="pageImg" alt="Pondering Man Image">
        <p>There are many factors to consider when buying a car. Each of these factors will also vary in importance depending on the person and their needs. 
            Thus, we have listed and described most of these factors for you to consider.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="accordion">
            <div class="container">
                <img src="image/budget.png"> 
                <h2 class="label"><i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Budget</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    Budget can be a very limiting factor when it comes to your car options. 
                    This is especially true if you have a low budget.
                    Not only do you have to pay for the car itself, you also have to pay additional expenses just for having the car. 
                    If budget is an issue, these are some important budget factors to consider about your potential car: 
                    <br>
                    <h3>Initial Cost</h3>
                    Generally speaking, European cars are not budget-friendly. They are usually more expensive to purchase compared to other brands. 
                    This is especially true if you live in North America. Another general rule is that the higher your car's initial cost, the higher the insurance costs.
                    So again, European cars will incur higher car insurance expenses.
                    On top of that, European cars have higher maintenance costs. 
                    This is due to many factors, such as their higher quality but pricier parts, and the difference in how they're engineered compared to other cars leads to mechanics charging more.
                    <br>
                    <h3>New or Used</h3>
                    Obviously, newer cars will have higher initial costs. So, if you're on a budget, you should definitely rule out newer cars from your potential options.
                    The older the car the cheaper it will be up-front. But do keep in mind that very old cars will have more mileage and more mileage means more wear and tear. 
                    With more wear and tear, it is possible that older cars will have more issues that require you to replace parts and pay a mechanic.
                    However, if you know how to maintain a car yourself, you can significantly reduce these maintenance costs.
                    You may also be able to find replacement parts for cheap at salvage yards.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Fuel Efficiency</h3>
                    Another thing to consider with cars is how it consumes fuel. 
                    Diesel cars tend to be more fuel efficient, but diesel fuel is also usually more expensive than gasoline. 
                    If you're deciding between diesel or gas, they'll affect your fuel costs similarly.
                    With that said some cars are generally less fuel efficient regardless of whether it's diesel or gas.
                    A good example of a car that isn't fuel efficient are pick-up trucks.
                    Pick-up trucks guzzle up fuel because of their size.
                    Combustion engines with more cylinders also consume gas at a faster rate. So, consider getting a V4 (4 cylinders) rather than a V6 or V8 if budget is an issue.
                    <br>
                    <h3>Electric and Hybrid Vehicles</h3>
                    Compared to diesel or gasoline, electric and hybrid vehicles are more energy efficient. They can save you a lot of money on fuel costs every year.
                    However, electric and hybrid vehicles tend to be more expensive up-front unless you're fortunate enough to live in place where your government will give you incentives for buying these types of cars.
                    For example, in British Columbia you can get a provincial rebate of up to $3,000 and a federal rebate of $5,000. That's $8,000 of savings!!!

            <h2 class="label"><i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Family Size</h2>
            <div class="content">
                You will likely want to consider the size of your family when choosing a car. Even if you don't have a family, you may have roommates or friends that you'll often have as passengers.
                Either way, there's a variety of seating capacity when it comes to cars.          
                You could get a typical 5-seater like a sedan.
                Vans and SUV's (sports utility vehicles) could hold 7-15 people. However, the bigger your vehicle the faster it'll consumer fuel.
                2-seaters are usually luxury cars or sports cars which can get expensive.
                Or you could get a motorcycle which could carry you and 1 more person.
                Worse comes to worse, if you get the typical 5-seater and have 6 people in total you can stuff one person in the trunk. We're kidding, don't do this!

            <h2 class="label"><i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Lifestyle </h2>
            <div class="content">
                It may be obvious, but lifestyle factors such as work and hobbies should be taken into consideration when choosing a vehicle. 
                Sedans are great all around vehicles that are fuel efficient compared to their counterparts and have decent trunk space.
                If think you'll often transport large objects then consider getting a pick-up truck or a van with removable backseats.
                Vans and SUVs are also great if you travel with a lot of people, whether they're family or friends.
                SUVs and trucks can be driven off-road which make them great if you like to explore or hike.

            <h2 class="label"><i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Location</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <h3>Infrastructure for Electric Vehicles</h3>
                Depending on where you live certain cars might be great while others would not be practical.
                One of the biggest issues in regards to location, is that some places just won't have the necessary charging stations to make electric vehicles workable.
                Also, as we mentioned in the budget section, your area's government and/or jurisdiction may give purchasers incentives for buying electric and hybrid vehicles.
                <br>
                <h3>Regional Climate</h3>
                Another important factor in choosing the right car is the weather in your location. 
                In temperate or arctic regions you'll likely experience extreme changes in climate from season to season.
                If this is the case make sure that your car has a functional heater, air conditioner, defoggers, and windshield wipers.
                One of us has had a car where the heater and defoggers were dysfunctional. 
                When it got to winter season, you couldn't see through the glass properly which caused a lot of accidents. Luckily, no one was hurt but we don't want you to have to go through that!
                <br><br>
                If it ever snows in your area, then we suggest you purchase a car with an option for All-wheel drive or 4-wheel drive.
                Either of these options will give you better handling in the snow.
                On top of that, your car should at least be equipped with all season tires. Having back-up winter tires can help as well, especially in thicker levels of snow.

            <h2 class="label"><i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Driving Skills</h2>
            <div class="content">
                This mostly applies to new drivers, but you'll want to consider your driving skills when choosing a car. 
                If you're a less experienced driver, we suggest that you avoid driving larger cars.
                They're slightly tougher to maneuver, especially when trying to get in to tighter parking spots.
                We also suggest using an automatic transmission rather than a manual.
                Manuals can be difficult for beginners to operate because you'd have to manage the clutch and gear changes. An automatic transmission car would do that extra work for you.
                However, others would argue that starting off with a manual is better if you plan on learning it eventually anyways.
                You should also avoid rear-wheel drive if you're new. Rear-wheel drive vehicles are more likely to spin

        <h2 class="label"><i class="fa fa-plus-square"></i> Aesthetic and Prestige</h2>
        <div class="content">
            Of course, some of the appeals of car ownership are the physical beauty of the cars as well as the opportunity to show off one's status and money.
            Luxury vehicles and sports cars usually check both boxes for aesthetics and prestige.
            High-end brands usually have a lot of options when it comes to luxury vehicles and sports cars.
            Some of these high-end brands are: 
            <ul>
                <li>Ferrari</li>
                <li>Tesla</li>
                <li>Porsche</li>
                <li>Mercedes-Benz</li>
                <li>Mustang</li>
            </ul>
            These are just a few of the many high-end brands out there. 
            Cars come in different shapes and sizes.
            So, if you're looking for a specific aesthetic we advice you take your time browsing different cars and you'll eventually find the right one.  
            These will definitely be expensive to purchase and maintain, but that's kind of the point, right?
